# Jaccard Text Similarity

An application that takes two inputs as texts and utilizes the Jaccard method to compare how similar the two texts are via returning a score between 0 and 1. 

# What is the Jaccard Method?

The Jaccard Method, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient (originally coined coefficient de communaut√© by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of texts. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite texts, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample texts.

# The Jaccard Method Score

A returned score of 0 indicates there is no similarity between the two texts. 
A returned score of 1 indicates the two texts are 100% similar.

# Python File Descriptions

**stop_words**

A python file that contains common stop words. Stop words are words that will return innacurate results and must be removed before processing the texts. The Jaccard Method is based on the number of matching words in two texts and the presence of stop words in the texts will yield inaccurate results. The removal of stop words from texts will prevent false positives. This file may be modified depending on language and use case.

**clean**

A python script file containing the clean() function, which removes all stopwords and any redundant characters from a given text.

**main**

Contains the application consisting of the input class, get request, and post request.
